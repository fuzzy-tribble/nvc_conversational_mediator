# NVC Conversational Feedback Automation

This project is a proof of concept for an automated [NVC-based](https://www.cnvc.org/) conversational feeback tool. It uses a combination of syntactical analysis and machine learning to provide users with feeback about how they are expressing themselves. 

The hope is to possibly use this tool to create games, and other tools that can help "operationalize peace" within America's school systems (see [TheBigbieMethod](https://www.thebigbiemethod.com/))


## Background
The language used in NVC is highly specific and structured. This makes it possible for us to use a combination of syntactical analysis and machine learning to provide users with feedback about how to turn their "regular language" conversations into non-violent communication conversations.

It is based on the premise that 
> All of humanity has a [shared set of NEEDS](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory)

For example cleanliness is NOT considered a need in NVC because not everyone needs cleanliness. 

> All of humanity has the capacity for a [shared set of FEELINGS](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/feelings-inventory). These feelings breakdown into two categories, feelings when we have unmet needs and feelings when our needs are met.

Once, we can identify our feelings and met or unmet needs in any given situation we can communicate with another human. 

**Sharing our feelings and *met needs* using NVC language sounds like this:**

*<span style="color:purple">When you kept your video on during the zoom meeting</span> I noticed something in me that felt <span style="color:orange">happy</span> because it met my need for <span style="color:brown">presence.</span>*

<span style="color:purple">OBSERVATION</span> -> <span style="color:orange">FEELING</span> -> <span style="color:brown">NEED</span>

**Sharing our feelings and unmet needs is structured the same way but frequently includes a request as well.**

*<span style="color:purple">When you left the house yesterday</span> I noticed something in me that felt <span style="color:orange">lonely</span> because I had an unmet need for <span style="color:brown">companionship.</span> Would you be willing <span style="color:green">to stay home and spend time with me today</span>?*

<span style="color:purple">OBSERVATION</span> -> <span style="color:orange">FEELING</span> -> <span style="color:brown">NEED</span> (-> <span style="color:green">REQUEST</span>)

**Note**: Aside from communicating our FEELINGS and NEEDS and making REQUESTS effectively, NVC also teaches EMPATHY however that is out of the scope of this project.
